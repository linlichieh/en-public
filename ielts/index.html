<ul>
<li>IELTS雅思考試共分聽、說、讀、寫四項科目。早上9AM起進行聽力、閱讀、寫作，約在中午完成；下午則依序進行口說考試。</li>
<li>不論IELTS雅思考試或IELTS for UKVI英國簽證雅思考試，均分Academic學術及General Training一般訓練兩組，兩組的聽力與口說考題是相同的，閱讀與寫作的題目則因組別而異。</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="general-training-unorganised">General Training (unorganised)</h3>
<p>IELTS</p>
<p>Writing Task 2, Listening and Speaking are the same for both IELTS Academic and IELTS general.</p>
<p>Writing task 2 is an essay. You will be given an essay question to answer in 40 minutes by writing at least 250 words.</p>
<p>The only difference between the two tests is Writing Task 1 and Reading.</p>
<p>[Writing Task 1]
General
Write a letter in one of the following styles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formal (to someone you do not know)</li>
<li>Semi-formal (to someone you know formally)</li>
<li>Informal (to friend or family)
You get 20 minutes to complete both of these tasks and must write at least 150 words for each.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Reading]</p>
<ul>
<li>4 short passages increasing in length and difficulty</li>
<li>More general /everyday style texts</li>
<li>Texts related to social survival (advertisements, notices etc.); workplace survival (job descriptions, employment contracts etc.); general texts (newspapers, magazines, travel brochures etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
<ul>
<li>60分鐘內需完成二篇作文</li>
<li>分 Academic組與General Training組</li>
<li>A組的Task 1為圖表練習，以描述及比較各類圖表為主，考生需於20分內寫完150字的描述。Task 2 則為申論題，範圍廣且有深度，考生需按題目分析及表達個人意見或做優缺點比較等</li>
<li>GT組的Task 1則與A組有別，通常為書信的撰寫如：邀請函，抱怨信，道歉信等，至少150字。而Task 2就與A組類似，為申論題</li>
</ul>
<p>題型</p>
<ul>
<li>TASK1：圖表分析或書信撰寫，至少150字, 建議 170~200 字
<ul>
<li>題型
<ul>
<li>line graph</li>
<li>bar chart</li>
<li>pie chart</li>
<li>table</li>
<li>comparison diagram (a diagram or map that compares things)</li>
<li>process diagram (a diagram or map that shows steps in a process)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>建議 20mins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TASK2：申論題，字數須250字以上。 (社會文化, 藝術, 交通與環境, 教育, 政府預算, 健康與兩性…等)
<ul>
<li>題型
<ul>
<li>Agree or Disagree e.g. &gt; Some people think that scientists experimenting with animals in a laboratory is the only way we can guarantee new products will be safe for human use. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</li>
<li>Advantages/Benefits outweigh Disadvantages/Drawbacks e.g. &gt; In some countries, governments are encouraging industries and businesses to move to regional areas outside the big cities. Do the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?</li>
<li>Discuss two views plus your opinion e.g. &gt; Some people say children no longer need to develop handwriting skills. Others believe that handwriting is still important. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.</li>
<li>Discuss two views only (no opinion) e.g. &gt; Many people believe that an effective public transport system is a key component of a modern city. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of public transport.</li>
<li>Causes/Problem and Solution e.g. &gt; Crime rates tend to be higher in cities than in smaller towns. Explain some possible reasons for this problem and suggest some solutions.</li>
<li>Two questions/ two-part questions e.g. &gt; To some people studying the past has little value in the modern world.  Why do you think it is important to do so? What will be the effect if children are not taught history?</li>
<li>Opinion e.g. &gt; Research indicates that the characteristics we are born with have much more influence on our personality and development than other experiences we may have in life. Which do you consider to be the major influence?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>建議 40mins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>總共 60mins</li>

<p>技巧</p>
<ul>
<li>PTT
<ul>
<li>A 同學
<ol>
<li>注意語氣，當說話的人加重、放輕或是重複的地方就是重點</li>
<li>單選題裡，有兩個很像或相反的句子，其中一個很可能是答案</li>
<li>不會的題目別停留、浪費時間</li>
<li>注意同義詞，像街道有好幾種說法:road、street、lane、avenue</li>
<li>運用符號作筆記，像是∵因為、∴所以、→表因果關係、⊙裡面、○外面等, 還有可以用字母代表文字，像 four years ago 變成4ys←，表示四年前。</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>B 同學: 然後關於大家常犯的注意單複數有無s、時態要不要加ed，這邊很重要的技巧是拿到先審題，把題目說可以寫幾字配幾個數字圈起來，每個答案格前的主動詞或時態圈起來，還有同樣一排其他題目是都大寫還小寫？或是不是在句首？也標記下來。這些標記務必！務必！務必！要做，我考前靠這個訣竅減少很多錯誤題數</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li>分Academic組與General Training組，都為60分鐘的測驗時間。</li>
<li>A組有3篇文章，每篇約1,000字，題型含配對、選擇、填充等，主要測驗考生閱讀長篇文章時快速抓到重點的能力；而GT組則約5篇文章，含短篇如廣告、公告、簡介等</li>
<li>答題方式亦包含配對、是非、填充、選擇、簡答、標籤題等</li>
</ul>
<p>題型</p>
<ul>
<li>分為三到四大篇文章，字數約600~ 900不等。 (依考試組別不同而有異) 且學術組文章難度比一般訓練組高許多。 (YES/NO/NOT GIVEN或TRUE/FALSE/NOT GIVEN, 配對段落大意, 觀點判斷, 填圖表, 填文意, 問答)</li>
<li>總共60分鐘
<ul>
<li>第一篇建議15mins (easier)</li>
<li>第二篇建議20mins</li>
<li>第三篇建議25mins (harder)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>技巧</p>
<ul>
<li>PTT
<ul>
<li>A 同學: 按順序看
<ol>
<li>有圖片先看圖片、有標題先看標題:大標題→副標題→小標題</li>
<li>先看題目再看文章</li>
<li>文章一二段看仔細，了解文章大意、背景、作者態度等</li>
<li>看每一段開頭跟結尾</li>
<li>速度快的題目先做(字彙、填空)、慢的(主旨、挑錯、細節)放後面</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>B 同學: 我後來的方法是先看完一或兩大題（例如TF或NG的、還有段落選標題的）就回頭讀文章，大家都知道答案跟題目是照順序，所以秉持答案都在文章裡的原則，閱讀真的是最易拿分的一項</li>

<p>Describe a sport match you have watched.</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<ul>
<li>What it is</li>
<li>When you watched it</li>
<li>How was it</li>
<li>And explain why you liked watching it.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, football is the only sport program that I usually watch with my brother. I’m terrible at playing football but watching a football match is my favorite. Both home and away games bring me a lot of levels of emotion. However, today I would like to tell about a match that I did not care about the score.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There was an occasion a few years ago when I went to watch a football match in a town about half an hour from where I live by bike. It was a charity match to collect funds for the local school – and it was very well attended. I think there must have been over 5,000 people there, which isn’t bad because there weren’t any star players. The atmosphere was so exciting that it encouraged the players a lot as soon as they came into the football pitch with the referee. My brother and I 100 percent focused on the match and provoked the players in two teams for their fair play.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am really deep into this football match for a number of reasons. Firstly, the players in two teams are not the professors, but they really ensured fair play and no red and yellow cards were released. Secondly, because of the charity aim of the match, the ticket fair then was donated for this local school and poor children, so I felt happy to contribute something to help other people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, it is the most unforgettable match that I have ever lively watched.</p>

<p>Question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The line graph below shows changes in the amount and type of fast food consumed by Australian teenagers from 1975 to 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The line graph compares the fast food consumption of teenagers in Australia between 1975 and 2000, a period of 25 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, the consumption of fish and chips declined over the period, whereas the amount of pizza and hamburgers that were eaten increased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Body1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1975, the most popular fast food with Australian teenagers was fish and chips, being eaten 100 times a year. This was far higher than Pizza and hamburgers, which were consumed approximately 5 times a year. However, apart from a brief rise again from 1980 to 1985, the consumption of fish and chips gradually declined over the 25 year timescale to finish at just under 40.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Body2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In sharp contrast to this, teenagers ate the other two fast foods at much higher levels. Pizza consumption increased gradually until it overtook the consumption of fish and chips in 1990. It then levelled off from 1995 to 2000. The biggest rise was seen in hamburgers as the occasions they were eaten increased sharply throughout the 1970’s and 1980’s, exceeding that of fish and chips in 1985. It finished at the same level that fish and chips began, with consumption at 100 times a year.</p>

<p>Question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chart shows the expenditure of two countries on consumer goods in 2010.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chart illustrates the amount of money spent on five consumer goods (cars, computers, books, perfume and cameras) in France and the UK in 2010. Units are measured in pounds sterling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, the UK spent more money on consumer goods than France in the period given. Both the British and the French spent most of their money on cars whereas the least amount of money was spent on perfume in the UK compared to cameras in France. Furthermore, the most significant difference in expenditure between the two countries was on cameras.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Body Paragraph 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In terms of cars, people in the UK spent about £450,000 on this as opposed to the French who spent £400,000. Similarly, the British spent more money on books than the French (around £400,000 and £300,000 respectively). In the UK, expenditure on carmeras (just over £350,000) was over double that of Franch, which was only £150,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Body Paragraph 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the amount spent on the remaining goods was higher in France. About £350,000 was spent by the French on computers which was slightly more than the British who spent exactly £350,000. Neither of the countries spent much on perfume which accounted for £200,000 of expenditure in Franch but under £150,000 in the UK.</p>

<p>Q:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More and more people are migrating to cities in search of a better life, but city life can be extremely difficult. Explain some of the difficulties of living in a city. How can governments make urban life better for everyone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cities are often seen as places of opportunity, but there are also some major drawbacks of living in a large metropolis. In my opinion, governments could do much more to improve city life for the average inhabitant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>B1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main problem for anyone who hopes to migrate to a large city is that the cost of living is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. Inhabitants of cities have to pay higher prices for housing, transport, and even food. Another issue is that urban areas tend to suffer from social problems such as high crime and poverty rates in comparison with rural areas. Furthermore, the air quality in cities is often poor, due to pollution from traffic, and the streets and public transport systems are usually overcrowded. As a result, city life can be unhealthy and stressful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>B2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, there are various steps that governments could take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could invest money in the building of affordable or social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, politicians have the power to ban vehicles from city centres and promote the use of cleaner public transport, which would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic congestion. In London, for example, the introduction of a congestion charge for drivers has helped to curb the traffic problem. A third option would be to develop provincial towns and rural areas, by moving industry and jobs to those regions, in order to reduce the pressure on major cities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>C:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, governments could certainly implement a range of measures to enhance the quality of life for all city residents.</p>
